# MUX OS - the minimal user experience
Just a small os
Status: printing numbers

The kernel is built using a i686-elf cross-compiler.
If you want to compile it yourself refer to https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler

This is a 32-bit kernel. In the future I will also add support for 64-bit.

The kernel was not tested on real hardware. It currently works in QEMU.
